Mild: This condition has a large number of records, with a moderate average profit (448.65),

Very Cold: Lowest average profit (143.63),

Warm: The highest total profit (6136006.00) due to both a high number of records and moderate profit levels,
 making it the most significant overall contributor.*/

/*
Warm and Mild temperatures (0.25 - 0.75 range) seem to have the highest total profits, with Warm being the most profitable.
Cold and Very Cold temperatures correspond to lower profits.
Hot temperatures have high average profits per ride but occur less frequently, likely due to fewer records available.
This suggests that moderate (Warm, Mild) conditions drive better business outcomes,
 possibly because extreme temperatures (Hot or Very Cold) might discourage riding activity.*/

/*Profit:
Total_Profit in yr 0: 4,938,541.37 whereas Total_Profit in yr 1: 10,200,134.16
Profit Increase Percentage: 106.54%
 This substantial increase shows a doubling of profit from the previous year.
Revenue:
Total_Revenue in yr 1: 10,227,384.24 Whereas Total_Revenue in yr 0: 4,959,980.97
Revenue Increase Percentage: 106.20%
High Humidity Impact: From the data, higher humidity levels (e.g., 0.88, 0.86, etc.) seem to be associated with lower average profits, 
lower total profits, and lower average revenues compared to lower humidity levels (e.g., 0.38, 0.44, etc.). 
This could indicate that customers might prefer renting bikes in moderate to low humidity conditions, 
leading to higher profits during these periods.
The growth rate observed (over 100% increase) sets a high benchmark for future performance*

-- Recommendation

/*Insights for Improvement:
1. Weather Analysis: Target promotions and discounts on Weathersit 3 & 4 days to minimize 
   the impact of poor weather on revenue.
   
2. Rider Retention: Focus on converting casual riders to registered riders to maximize customer lifetime value,
   by Offering discounts, loyalty rewards, and premium features for registered users could help convert more casual users.
   
3. Hourly Promotions: Offer incentives during low-profit hours, such as late nights, to increase ridership.

4. Peak Hours Optimization: Enhanced availability of bikes, 
   dynamic pricing, or even partnerships with local businesses for after-work commuting could be explored.
   
5. Given the spike in profits during summer and early fall, launching seasonal campaigns could boost revenue. 
   Targeted promotions for tourists or special discounts during high-traffic months
   like July and September could further enhance profitability.
   
6. Focus on Mild to Warm Weather with moderate less humdity: Given that warm and mild conditions are consistently profitable,
   targeting marketing efforts and availability during these conditions could boost overall performance and adapt to Extreme Conditions,
   consider offering promotions or discounts during extreme cold or windy conditions to incentivize ridership,
   as these conditions lead to lower profits also optimize Resource Allocation based on the weather forecast, 
   we can adjust staff and bike availability, reducing them in low-profit conditions
   (e.g., very cold or high winds) and maximizing them during profitable conditions*/
